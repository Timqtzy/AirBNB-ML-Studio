I make myself available to recommend local experiences and to enhance your stay however possible. I can also leave you your space and allow you to soak up the good times!

My work takes me across the world and I therefore have great contacts all over. With my extensive online experiences, I've decided to start renting out my properties and those of other people that are looking to make their property become an income generator.

If i'm staying at your place, rest assured that I will treat like my own and leave it cleaner than when I arrived. I usually do the turnover as that is what I would wish for. ;)

As a host or property manager, I make sure your stay is comfortable, enjoyable and memorable. 

I look forward to hosting you and making you feel at home. 

I speak English, French and Spanish and I am available for any questions at all times.

The best way to describe myself is an eccentric world traveler, documentarian, humanitarian, alchemist, explorer who is in search for the truth and not a slave to the illusion of the system. I'm an open-minded and friendly guy who has been traveling the world for the past 26 years through 168 countries on 6 continents, from the roof of Africa on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, through the jungles of south-east Asia to the southern tip of Patagonia on Tierra del Fuego. This lifestyle has allowed me to share the love of many cultures, religions and races around the world. Always in motion to explore the splendors of our planet with a never-ending, ever-changing magnificent views and realities. I started my journey in 1988 and haven't looked back to the illusion. I am attracted to adventure, nature, cultural diversity, history, architecture, wildlife, anthropology and unique customs. My motivation for this choice of lifestyle is to experience, learn and meet as many people while witnessing as many traditional activities as I can during my life time. At the same time, my true passion is my humanitarian work supporting people in third world countries with education, water, food, medicine, business creation, life necessities and love. My main goal is to create a bridge from the developed world to the impoverished people of the world, creating equality and opportunity. Being a citizen of the world gives you the feeling of being connected to the entire planet and having a real understanding of the people who live on it makes you feel so appreciative to be alive and thankful to be apart of it. It makes you realize the whole world is our home and we are all family in it. This is why I am opening up my home to other travelers to stay while expanding my international network of friends. If you really want to know who I am and what I do, check out my documentaries on my Youtube channel at SELIM FEHMI OZCAN or my photos on my private website at True MyEyes.

I loved spending time with my Grandparents here, and have many fond memories of these New Brunswick summers. 
My Uncle and Aunt recently moved back to the Miramichi and ventured into the vacation rental business.  They opened up Cast Away Vacation rentals in May of 2020 and have thoroughly enjoyed helping guests create special and memorable vacations on the beautiful Miramichi River.
My husband Mike and I (with our three children) have decided to jump on board with the intent to carry on creating these exciting experiences for guests at the Lodge and at our newest property the Grand Lodge.
